# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nano - IAM Final Project


This project part Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity

### Installing Dependencies

Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip, node, and npm installed.



# Front End

## Installing Dependencies

#### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing Ionic Cli

The Ionic Command Line Interface is required to serve and build the frontend. Instructions for installing the CLI  is in the [Ionic Framework Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```


## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

Ionic ships with a useful development server which detects changes and transpiles as you work. The application is then accessible through the browser on a localhost port. To run the development server, cd into the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
ionic serve
```

>_tip_: Do not use **ionic serve**  in production. Instead, build Ionic into a build artifact for your desired platforms.
[Checkout the Ionic docs to learn more](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/build)<br>



# Backend

## Installing Dependencies

### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)


### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

#### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. Since we want you to focus on auth, we handle the heavy lift for you in `./src/database/models.py`. We recommend skimming this code first so you know how to interface with the Drink model.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

# Running the server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

Each time you open a new terminal session, run:


To run the server, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

The server will run in debug mode if you need to disable this you 

need to remove  app.debug = True


### Setup Auth0
